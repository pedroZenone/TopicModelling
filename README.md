# Topic Modelling

All projects start with an specific problem to solve, in this case the creative area wanted to understand "what is being talked about when we talk about a certain theme?" for example you may want to understand wich are the main problems when a Telco's companie is mentioned, the main topics of youtubers conversation or even undertand consumer profiles of a certain brand.

So, an interesting technique that allow us to solve this problem is the Latent Dietrich Allocation (LDA). This one cluster the words asigning it a probability of belonging to a topic. Finally, looking at the words contained in each topic you can interpret it adding value to the analysis.

Here is the workflow in this kind of proyects:
