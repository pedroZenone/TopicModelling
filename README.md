# Topic Modelling

All projects start for solving an specific problem, in this case the creative area wanted to understand "what is being talked about when we talk about a certain theme?" for example you may want to understand wich are the main problems when a Telco's companie is mentioned, the main topics of youtubers conversation or even undertand wich are the consumers profile of a certain brand.
